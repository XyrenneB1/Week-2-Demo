<h2>Systematic Evolution</h2>
<p>Scientific Information about Penguins</p>
<h3>Taxonomy</h3>
<p>The family name of Spheniscidae was given by Charles Lucien Bonaparte from the genus Spheniscus,[24] the name of that genus comes from the Greek word σφήν sphēn "wedge" used for the shape of an African penguin's swimming flippers.[25]</p>
<h3>Evolution</h3>
<p>Although the evolutionary and biogeographic history of Sphenisciformes is well-researched, many prehistoric forms are not fully described. Some seminal articles about the evolutionary history of penguins have been published since 2005.</p>
<h2>Anatomy and Physiology</h2>
<p>Penguins are superbly adapted to aquatic life. Their wings have evolved to become flippers, useless for flight in the air. In the water, however, <em are astonishingly agile. Penguins' swimming looks very similar to birds' flight in the air.[47][better source needed] Within the smooth plumage a layer of air is preserved, ensuring buoyancy. The air layer also helps insulate the birds in cold waters. On land, penguins use their tails and wings to maintain balance for their upright stance.</p>
